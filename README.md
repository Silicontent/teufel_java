# Teufel Sechs: The Ultimatum
The sixth and final version of the "pain pack," now in Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.1 which makes the game a much more difficult and unfair challenge. Originally a port of Teufel Fünf, the fifth pack in the [Teufel series](https://github.com/Silicontent/teufel_collection) of Minecraft Bedrock addons.
