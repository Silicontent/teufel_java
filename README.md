# Teufel: Java Edition
A port/remaster of the fifth pack in [Teufel series](https://github.com/Silicontent/teufel_collection) of Minecraft Bedrock addons, built from the ground up in Fabric for Minecraft Java. The intention is to move the final version of the "pain pack," Teufel Sechs: The Ultimatum, onto Java Edition only. As such, this port of Teufel Fünf is more-or-less a test.
